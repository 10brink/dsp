#### 5) Think Stats Exercise 8.2

# Suppose that you draw a sample with size *n* = 10 from an exponential distribution with *Î»* = 2. Simulate this experiment 1000 times and plot the sampling distribution of the estimate *L*. Compute the standard error of the estimate and the 90% confidence interval.

# Repeat the experiment with a few different values of *n* and make a plot of standard error versus *n*.
