# 6) Think Bayes Exercise 2.1

[Think Bayes Chapter 2 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/html/thinkbayes003.html#toc22) 

The cookie problem is a problem discussed in sections 1.3, 2.2 and 2.3 of Think Bayes. Solve the following problem.

In Section 2.3 I said that the solution to the cookie problem generalizes to the case where we draw multiple cookies with replacement.

But in the more likely scenario where we eat the cookies we draw, the likelihood of each draw depends on the previous draws.

Modify the solution in this chapter to handle selection without replacement. Hint: add instance variables to Cookie to represent the hypothetical state of the bowls, and modify Likelihood accordingly. You might want to define a Bowl object.
