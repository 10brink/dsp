# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with both Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

Of course, depending on your experience with Python, you may want to spend more or less time with these materials.

Complete the following exercises to check your ability with Python. _**Each solution should be submitted in the appropriate file.**_

 * [Strings](python/strings.py)
 * [Lists](python/lists.py)
 * [Dict and File](python/exercise_03.py)
