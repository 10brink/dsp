# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

There are two sets of challenges. Please make sure to complete **all 9 problems**. There is an additional bonus problem that you can complete as well.  

#### PART I

---

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.

Explain list comprehensions. Give examples and show equivalents with `map` and `filter`. How do their capabilities compare? Also demonstrate set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

Use python to compute days between start and stop date.  
_Hint:  use Google to find python function_ 

    date_start = '01-02-2013'  
    date_stop = '07-28-2015'   

    date_start = '12312013'  
    date_stop = '05282015'  

    date_start = '15-Jan-1994'  
    date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'

#### PART II

The first part of this section contains practice exercises that will use skills in regular expressions, writing to csv file, and dictionary.  

  * [Parsing](python/parsing.py)  
  * [CSV, Regex, Dictionary](python/faculty.py)

These next exercises are implemented with doctests, which are runnable tests inside docstrings. Fill in the function definitions. Correct solutions will make it possible to run (for example) `python -m doctest strings.py` with no messages about failures.

 * [Strings](python/strings.py)
 * [Lists](python/lists.py)
 
If you're all done and looking for an extra challenge, then please solve the following problem:

 * [Markov](python/markov.py)
