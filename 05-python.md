For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

There are two sets of challenges. There are **9 compulsory problems**. There is an additional bonus problem that you can complete if you wish. Part I has 5 questions (below) and Part II consists of a series of 4 challenges.
