# Metis Data Science Bootcamp Prework

There is some work to be done!


### Installing packages

You will first follow the online tutorials for installing some
critical packages that will be used in the course: command line tools,
ipython notebook, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas and
git. You can follow our [installation guide](installation.md) to do that.


### Command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours. Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of
these commands and (very briefly) what they do.


### Emacs (or text editor of your choice)

While we will also use ipython notebooks and the Python IDE during the
bootcamp, in the end the process of coding mostly involves writing
code files in a text editor and running these files with Python. You
can find out about text editors [here](editors.md).


### Python

We will work with Python (2.7) throughout the course, and [learning and
getting familiar with Python](python.md) is crucial.


### Statistics

Time to freshen up your statistics knowledge! We have a
[guide](stats.md) for doing exactly that. The exercises go hand in
hand with these, so please check both of them.

There are 6 required and 6 optional problems are listed. Do them while
you're reading the relevant statistics chapters.
