# Learn Statistics

Read Allen Downey's [Think Stats (second edition)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) and [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/) for getting up to speed with core ideas in statistics and how to approach them programmatically. Both books are completely available online, or you can buy physical copies if you would like.

Some people enjoy video content such as Khan Academy's [Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability) or the much longer and more in-depth Harvard [Statistics 110](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo). You might also be interested in the book [Statistics Done Wrong](http://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/) or a very short [overview](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/the-math-you-need-to-start/) from School of Data.

#### 5) The Elvis Twin Problem

Elvis Presley had a twin brother who died at birth.  What is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin?

To answer this one, you need some background information. According to the Wikipedia article on twins:

> "Twins are estimated to be approximately 1.9% of the world population, with monozygotic twins making up 0.2% of the total---and 8% of all twins."


#### 6) The Locomotive Problem

A railroad numbers its locomotives in order from 1 to N. One day you see a locomotive with the number 60. Estimate how many locomotives the railroad has.

Think Bayes Chapter 3 actually solves this ambiguous-looking problem. Itâ€™s a pretty cool problem to solve with a Bayesian approach. Try thinking about it and coming up with an answer before looking at the chapter.
